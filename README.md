# DevCamper

This project is based on the [DevCamper API](https://github.com/bradtraversy/devcamper-api) created by Brad Traversy.

The goal of this project is to provide a functioning API that serves as the backend for an application that displays developer bootcamp information. My goal in providing this project, based on a well-known example, is to incorporate a testing challenge into it. There is currently no active frontend for this application, so the focus is entirely on building and testing an API.
