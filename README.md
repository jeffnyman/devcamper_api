# DevCamper

This project is based on the [DevCamper API](https://github.com/bradtraversy/devcamper-api) created by Brad Traversy.

The goal of this project is to provide a functioning API that serves as the backend for an application that displays developer bootcamp information. My goal in providing this project, based on a well-known example, is to incorporate a testing challenge into it. There is currently no active frontend for this application, so the focus is entirely on building and testing an API.

For development purposes, you can start the server with:

```
npm run dev
```

Resource route structure of the application:

* /api/v1/bootcamps
* /api/v1/courses
* /api/v1/reviews
* /api/v1/auth
* /api/v1/users
